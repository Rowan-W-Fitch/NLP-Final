 • Through the air by coughing and sneezing;
• Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands;
• Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or
eyes before washing your hands.
WHEREAS, the CDC reports that COVID-19 may be spread before an infected person shows symptoms of the virus; and
WHEREAS, as of Thursday, March 26, 2020, the CDC reports 27 U.S. states are reporting some community spread of COVID-19, meaning people have been infected with the virus who may not have the usual risks of international travel or known contact with a confirmed case; and
WHEREAS, in the days since the Governor declared a State of Emergency, the COVID-19 outbreak in New Hampshire has expanded significantly; and
WHEREAS, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 continues to rise in the State: as of March 26, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health Services has reported 158 cases of COVID-19, of which 33 are healthcare workers, 1 death, 16 hospitalizations; 650 individuals being monitored; 592 persons with tests pending at the Public Health Lab; and 9 of the 10 counties in the State have been impacted; and
WHEREAS, the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health has found that community-based transmission of COVID-19 continues to increase in the State and has been identified in the majority of counties; and

WHEREAS, ifCOVID-19 spreads in New Hampshire at a rate comparable to the rate of spread in other states and countries, the number ofpersons requiring medical care may exceed locally available resources, and controlling outbreaks minimizes the risk to the public, maintains the health and safety of the people of New Hampshire, and limits the spread of infection in our communities and within the healthcare delivery system; and
