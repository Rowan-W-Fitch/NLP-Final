people can leave their home to perform any of five “essential activities,” though people who are at high risk of severe illness and people who are already sick are urged to stay in their homes unless seeking medical attention.
“Essential activities,” according to the order:
Engaging in or performing tasks essential to health and safety, or to the health and safety of family/household members. This includes pets. Examples include picking up medicine, visiting a doctor or getting supplies to work from home.
Obtaining necessary supplies or to deliver supplies to others. Things like groceries count here.
Going for a run, hike, or other outdoor activity, as long as proper social distancing is observed.
To care for a family member or pet in another household
To perform work at an essential business (see below) or perform minimum basic operations
People can leave their homes for “healthcare operations.” That doesn’t include “fitness and exercise gyms and similar facilities,” the order states.
What is an essential business?
Santa Clara’s FAQ includes a list of 21 essential business. Most deal with healthcare or providing food and labor to the public. All of the businesses on the list come with social distancing caveats – for example, if an educational institution is still open, people are to remain six feet away from each other as often as possible.
Newspapers, television, radio, and other media services are included in the list, as are businesses that supply things needed for people to work from home. Businesses “that supply other essential businesses with the support or supplies necessary to operate” are also considered essential.
