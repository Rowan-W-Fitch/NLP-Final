Gov. Tony Evers has directed state health officials to issue a stay-at-home order for Wisconsin prohibiting non-essential travel, with some exceptions, amid the continued spread of COVID-19 in the state.

The order, issued Tuesday morning by the state Department of Health Services at the direction of the governor, will go into effect at 8 a.m. on Wednesday, March 25, and remain in effect until April 24, unless another order is made in the interim. 

Under the order, people don't need permission to leave their homes, but are only allowed to do so for specific things, like going to the grocery store or to the doctor. People will be allowed to exercise outside, but are required to keep six feet between themselves and others, unless they live with the person. Group sports, like basketball, soccer and ultimate frisbee, are banned. Playgrounds are also closed.

Essential businesses and operations, like hospitals, grocery stores, hardware stores and pharmacies, are allowed to continue operations and donâ€™t need any special certification to do so.
