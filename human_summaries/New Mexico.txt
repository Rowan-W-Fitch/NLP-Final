With the coronavirus spreading in two of New Mexico’s most populous counties, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Monday announced the closure of all “non-essential” businesses statewide and delivered a blunt message to state residents.
The message: Stay home and only go out when absolutely necessary.
“If we limit person to person contact, we will be doing everything in our power to slow the spread,” Lujan Grisham said during a Monday news briefing at the state Capitol.
The “stay at home” order is functionally no different than the “shelter in place” orders implemented by the governors of California, New York and several other states, the governor’s aides said.
Starting today, most retail stores, call centers and other businesses will be closed, under an amended public health order issued by Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel. The order is in effect through April 10, but could end up being extended.
