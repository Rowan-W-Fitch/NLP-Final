Gov. Phil Scott is asking all Vermonters to stay at home to mitigate the spread of the new coronavirus, or COVID-19.

He issued the order Tuesday evening on his office's website. The order will take effect Wednesday at 5 p.m. and will remain in effect until at least April 15.

Vermonters are being asked to stay in their homes or residences, but may leave for "essential reasons," the governor's order states. These reasons include:

Personal safety.
Groceries or medicine.
Curbside pickup for goods, meals or beverages. 
Medical care.
Exercise.
Care of others. 
For certain people, work.
