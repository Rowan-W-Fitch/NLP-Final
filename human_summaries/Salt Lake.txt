Salt Lake County has issued its version of a stay-at-home order, forcibly closing more businesses, such as barbershops, salons and tattoo parlors, and directing all individuals to limit their trips outside to only “essential activities."

The move came the same day that Utah’s confirmed cases of COVID-19 reached 719 — up 117 from the previous day. It’s now the second day in a row with a jump of more than 100 in the state, according to new figures released Sunday by the Utah Department of Health.
